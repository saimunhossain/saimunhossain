# Hi, I am Saimun Hossain

I am working as a Software Developer at [Singularity Limited](https://www.singularitybd.com)

<!-- I started programming in high school, now I am trying to make a career out of my hobby. I love the world of backend and systems development. I know my fair share of languages, JS and Python are the one's I use the most, trying to do more of C++. I love linux, I have friends who nag me to run Arch but I am happy with my custom Ubuntu setup â€¦. -->

### What I am up to right now 

<!-- * I am writing and recording some fun youtube tutorials on the C programming language [@DSCKIIT](https://github.com/DSC-KIIT). You can find them [here](https://github.com/DSC-KIIT/C-tutorials)

<!--* I am working as a web developer for [Desire Foundation](https://github.com/desirefoundation), currently working on their blog infrastructure. It's mostly TypeScript, GatsbyJS, Express and SQL.

<!--* Also working with [@rohankmr414](https://github.com/rohankmr414) and [@coolfool](https://github.com/coolfool) on a discord bot to trigger our dedicated CS:GO Servers -->

### What I am currently learning

<!-- I am trying to get better at the whole domain of deep learning. Math and computers have always fascinated me, I have some experience with ML and I am just trying to learn more. 

<!-- Currently doing the [Deep Learning Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) course by Andrew Ng and alongside that I am reading [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Ian Goodfellow. I am also learning Vim, because why not. -->
